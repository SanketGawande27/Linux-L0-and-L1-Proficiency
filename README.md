      ( Assignments: Programs on Shell Scripting )
      1. The first task was to Accept a file name and a number (x) and Display x lines from the top of the file. Check if the file exists and is readable.
      The value of x should not exceed the total number of lines in the files. Display suitable messages in case an error is encountered.
      The above Assign1.sh I wrote an shell script program to run this problem statement.
      
      2. Accept roll number from the user at the command line. Search it in the “student” file. If it is present, then display the name, percentage,
      grade and class of the student. If the roll number is not present, then display a message “not found”. Allow the user to enter any number of queries.
      The above Assign2.sh I wrote an shell script program to run this problem statement.
      
      3. I wrote a shell script which will accept three nos. from the keyboard and finds the largest of them.
