      ( Assignments: Programs on Shell Scripting )
      1. The first task was to Accept a file name and a number (x) and Display x lines from the top of the file. Check if the file exists and is readable. The value of x should not exceed the total number of lines in the files. Display suitable messages in case an error is encountered.
      The above Assign1.sh I wrote an shell script program to run this problem statement.
